Drug Dispenser Templates - Ed Jeanty

Image1 - I have a lot of critics to give, The primary functions with this one was setting up reminders for the users, on the left hand side I imagined a calendar you make entries with after which u press submit
and it populates in the schedule list above, with the sticky notes I tried to be a bit more creative but basically the sticky are simply a way of adding what type of medicine you want to add, I invision this being
for elder folk so I so I was leaning more translating physical to digital if that makes sense. I wanted it to look and feel like something you'd do in real life but on a web interface. This point and slides on the
side are suppose to represent visual changes the user could modify. The bottom circle is a progress tracker. I have to say this is a very weak design, I struggled with the level of effect I should put into this and
If I should keep it on one page, I tried to keep it simple and I based this off a real world Chat Application I've worked with for elders. This is not intuitive perhaps it'd be easier to understand if I had actual text
but It definitely needs improvment and feels more like a pile of icons slapped together, Also I hate the color scheme.

Image2 - I followed your advise and decided to go the complete opposite way, which means a lot more effect and adding tabs, The original design had alot of weakness so I tried to create a list of things that needed to be
added that were either left out or weren't fully realized, My list. User Authentication, Medication Reminders, Refill Reminders, Medication History, Dosage Tracking, Barcode Scanning, Doctor and Pharmacy Information,
Emergency Information, Data Export. I favored a website design I didn't create a tab for Barcode scanning as I'd invision that to open your camera app, as for Data export it would just download a excel file type. It took
a lot of research to come up with this list and while it's for sure an improvement and a lot more intutive, the design just seems horrible to me. The idea with the User Dashboard is basically u create an entry and it pops
up down below with the relevent information, I don't know it just seems bare, or maybe it should be more simple. I also very much dislike the color scheme I got the idea from breast care awareness but it comes off as more
of a eye sore. Truth is I feel like i'd do alot better setting up the functions of a GUI then designing one.

Favorite feature for image 1 is the sticky notes even though it doesn't make sense I like it, Favorite feature form image 2 it feels like a website i've been before which feels nice.
